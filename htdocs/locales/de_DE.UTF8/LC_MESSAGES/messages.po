msgid "A FTP file transfer needs two connections: command channel (21/tcp) and a data channel. If you use active FTP the port for data channel is 20/tcp. If you use passive FTP, the port of the data channel is not predictable and is choosen by the ftp server (high port). But with the help of the iptables kernel module ip_conntrack_ftp you get the data channel which belongs to the command channel! Don't forget to load the ip_conntrack_ftp module!"
